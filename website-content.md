## **ABOUT PAGE**

### **Our Story**

Haus of Color Painting LLC was founded by Lillian Haus, a seasoned painting professional with over two decades of hands-on experience transforming homes and businesses across central Florida.

After years as a trusted foreman for one of Tampa Bay's leading painting contractors, Lillian saw an opportunity to build something different—a company where quality craftsmanship, honest communication, and customer respect aren't just promises, they're the foundation of every project.

### **What Makes Us Different**

**Experience You Can Trust**

With 20+ years in the painting industry, we've seen it all: challenging weather conditions, complex surface prep, intricate color matching, and tight deadlines. That depth of experience means we can anticipate issues before they become problems and deliver results that exceed expectations.

**Foreman-Level Quality on Every Job**

At Haus of Color, you're not getting a crew supervised by someone learning on the job. You're getting foreman-level expertise applied to every detail—from surface preparation to final touch-ups.

**Built for Central Florida**

We understand the unique demands of painting in Florida's climate: intense UV exposure, high humidity, salt air, and hurricane season. Every project is approached with this local knowledge in mind, ensuring finishes that look great and last.

**Your Satisfaction Is Our Reputation**

As a locally owned and operated business, our reputation is everything. We're not a faceless franchise—we're your neighbors, and we're invested in delivering work we're proud to stand behind.

---

### **Our Commitment to You**

* **Clear Communication:** You'll always know what's happening, when it's happening, and why.  
* **Respect for Your Property:** We protect your belongings, clean up daily, and treat your home or business like our own.
